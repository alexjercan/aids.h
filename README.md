# aids.h

Header only library for my most used helpers in C projects. This is a
continuation of the [ds.h](github.com/alexjercan/ds.h) project. The name means
- all in one data structures.

### Quickstart

```c
#define AIDS_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "aids.h"
```

Check the `how_to`'s for more details on how to use the library.
